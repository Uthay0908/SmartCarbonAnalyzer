# SmartCarbonAnalyzer
The Smart Travel Carbon Analyser is a sustainable travel solution designed to  estimate and monitor the carbon footprint of various transportation methods.  With the growing concern over climate change, it becomes imperative to  encourage environmentally conscious travel decisions. This project introduces a  system—either as a mobile app or web-based tool—that allows users to input their  travel details (such as mode of transport, distance, and frequency) to calculate CO₂  emissions in real time. It offers comparative insights across travel options (car, bus,  train, flight, cycling, etc.) and recommends greener alternatives when available.  The analyser also features a cumulative emissions tracker, carbon offset  suggestions, and sustainability tips. By raising awareness and promoting informed  decisions, the Smart Travel Carbon Analyser empowers individuals and  organizations to contribute actively to reducing their carbon footprint and fostering  a cleaner, greener future.
